# Legacy of Shadows
---

This module provides new archetypes, class features, feats, spell and items for Wrath of the Righteous.

And also some more random stuff that I wanted to see in the game.

All homebrew content or divergences from TT will be called out, but most homebrew content will probably be overpowered.

**How to install**

1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager), make sure it is at least version.
2. Run Unity Mod Manager and set it up to find Wrath of the Righteous.
3. Download the [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core/releases) mod from the releases page.
4. Download the [TabletopTweaks-Base](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Base/releases) mod from the releases page.
5. Download the mod from the releases page.
6. Install the mods by dragging the zip file from step 3 & 4 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab.

## Fixes
* UI Fixes
    * Dynamic Item Naming
        * Allows Weapon/Armor names to be modified by any additional enchants they gain outside of their base enchants.
    * Saving Throw Overtips
        * Overhead saving throw rolls now display the correct values
    * Spell Tooltips
        * Updates spell tooltips to include what spellbook the spell is in.
    * Suppressed Buffs
        * Suppressed buffs now have custom UI rules to better indicate them.
* Bases Fixes
    * Coup De Grace
        * Coup De Grace saving throw DC is now based on damage dealt.
    * Damage Reduction
        * Prevents most forms of damage reduction from stacking unless specifically specified.
    * Unlimited Abilities Combat Behavior
        * Allows abilities that have become unlimited to remain on after combat ends.
    * Natural Armor
        * Prevents Natural Armor bonuses from stacking unless they are specified to stack. These use normal descriptor rules still so a natural armor bonus and a natural armor enhancement bonus will still stack.
    * Polymorph Effects
        * Prevents multiple polymorph effects from being applied to a character at a time.
        * Active Polymorph effects will correctly suppress size effects from non polymorph spells.
    * Size Effects
        * Prevents multiple size changing buffs granting benefits at the same time. Old buffs are suppressed.
    * Size Limits
        * Size shifts are now supported from Fine to Colossal.
    * Feat Selections
        * Cleans up limited feat selections (like fighter combat feats) to include all feats of the specified type.
    * Background Modifiers
        * Changes the skill and attack bonuses granted from backgrounds into trait bonuses.
    * Critical Confirmation
        * Allows a natural 20 to always confirm a critical.
    * Inherent Stat Bonuses
        * Allows Inherent bonuses to intelligence to now grant bonus skill points.
    * Mounted Longspear
        * Spears now grant additional damage during a mounted charge in the same manor a lance would.
    * Enemy Buff CL
        * Enemy buffs now have the correct CL for applied buffs as defined on their blueprints.
        * Prebuffs will be applied at a more correct level instead of nearly always CL 20.
    * Shadow Spells
        * Shadow spells now are correctly treated as being from the Illusion school for all effects.
    * Mounted Movement
        * Prevents full round actions after moving while mounted.
    * Nauseated Condition
        * Removes the poison descriptor from nauseated.
    * Staggered Condition
        * Removes the movement impairing descriptor from staggered.
    * Invisibility
        * Invisibility now properly grants concealment.
    * Loading
        * Saves will now properly remember who cast buffs which should fix several bugs including idealize discovery not working on save load.
    * Scrolls
        * Scoll UMD DCs are now calculated correctly at 20 + Scroll CL instead of 20 + Scroll spell level.
    * Progressions
        * Progressions no longer display features you will not get.
